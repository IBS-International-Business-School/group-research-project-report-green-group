# Research on Gen Z and Electric Cars: ***A Case Study for Aston Martin***


The automotive industry is changing quickly, and electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming an important part of innovation, sustainability, and growth. With rising concerns about climate change and governments supporting green energy, car companies worldwide are shifting their focus. For luxury car brands like ***Aston Martin***, known for their classic designs and strong heritage, it is essential to adapt to these changes to stay relevant and competitive. 

This research looks at what Generation Z thinks about electric cars. This group is becoming an important customer base and will influence future trends in society and the market. Our research showed an interesting result: even though sustainability is a big global topic, Gen Z **doesn’t** have a very positive view of electric cars. This is both a challenge and an opportunity for Aston Martin.

## Research Objective

In this group project, we aim to answer the question: **How can Aston Martin connect with Generation Z and use their preferences to succeed in the electric car market?** Our goal is to give practical suggestions to Aston Martin's marketing team and help close the gap between the brand and this younger generation. 

## Research Approach

To achieve this, we carried out a survey to study generational attitudes toward electric cars, focusing on the factors that influence these views. We analyzed the survey data using Python and the Seaborn library, which gave us important insights into why Gen Z has a less positive view of electric cars compared to other age groups, even though they care about the environment.

This project follows research methods and lean/agile principles. We worked together using GitHub, documenting every step—from designing the survey and collecting data to analyzing and interpreting results. The survey had a sample of **72** people, evenly divided into three age groups, and included both numerical and open-ended questions. This approach helped us get a detailed understanding of people’s attitudes toward electric cars.

## Key Findings

Our results show that:

- Gen Z’s view of electric cars is neutral or slightly negative, with a positivity score of **2.33 out of 5**.  
- Millennials scored **2.54**, and older generations scored **2.60**.  
- Gen Z is also less likely to buy an electric car than other groups.  

This means their preferences and concerns need specific attention through targeted marketing strategies.

## Methodology

### Survey Design

The survey was designed to get a view of public perceptions of electric cars across three generations, focusing on Generation Z. This research aimed to provide actionable insights for the marketing department in an automotive company in order to better align strategies with consumer attitudes and preferences.

To ensure a comprehensive understanding of the generations’ opinion, the survey included a variety of question types:
- **Likert Scale Questions**: These questions measured for example respondents' attitudes toward electric cars on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), which was one of our survey’s key primer data sources. They addressed topics such as environmental impact, affordability, and technological appeal. This format enabled us to identify trends and subtle differences in perception across demographic groups.
- **Multiple-Choice Questions**: These questions explored factors influencing respondents’ likelihood of purchasing an electric car. Options included cost, charging infrastructure, maintenance, and brand reputation, allowing participants to select multiple factors that shaped their decisions.
- **Yes/No Questions**: Simple binary questions provided direct insights into specific perceptions, such as whether respondents viewed electric cars as practical or believed they were affordable.
- **Open-Ended Questions**: To complement quantitative data too, participants were offered to share additional thoughts, suggestions, or concerns in their own words. These qualitative responses offered additional insights to our team.

The survey was designed to be short and easily understandable, requiring only 5–10 minutes to complete.

### Sampling Method

Our sample consisted of 72 respondents, evenly distributed across three age groups: Generation Z (12–27 years), Millennials (28–43 years), and a group named "Others" (44+ years). This segmentation allowed for meaningful comparisons of generational differences in attitudes toward electric cars.

Participants were selected using a **convenience sampling** approach. The survey link was distributed through social media platforms, email, chat messages and university networks. While this method ensured time- and cost-effective data collection, it also had limitations, such as potential biases in demographic representation, but the even distribution across age groups helped us mitigate this limitation, allowing for balanced generational analysis.

### Data Collection Process

The survey was conducted online using **Google Forms**, a tool chosen for its user-friendliness and compatibility with various devices. The form remained open for approximately one week, giving respondents flexibility to participate at their convenience. This approach allowed for rapid and efficient data collection.

When closing the survey, the raw data was exported in **CSV format** for further analysis. The dataset was cleaned by us to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved only a few steps, such as removing incomplete responses, eliminating duplicates.

Data analysis was conducted using **Python**, with a particular focus on the **Seaborn library** for creating visualizations. Descriptive statistics, like mean scores were calculated to summarize responses. Additionally, bar charts and other visual tools were used to illustrate differences in perception across age groups. Open-ended responses were manually reviewed.

### Perception Across Age Groups
Apparent generational differences in attitudes toward electric cars are evident from our findings:

- **Gen Z**: With an average rating of **2.33**, it shows neutrality biased a little toward negativity. This may reflect hesitation or skepticism toward the purchase of electric vehicles within the Gen Z population.
- **Millennials**: With an average score of **2.54**, millennials are moderately positive, meaning interest and acceptance are on the rise.
- **Age 44+**: With the highest index of **2.60**, they had the best view about electric cars among the cohorts.

Overall, the data underlines a positive general attitude toward electric cars, though Generation Z lags in this enthusiasm.

### Likelihood of Purchasing
Generational differences exist when looking at how probable it is that electric cars would be bought:

- **Generation Z**: Scored **2.71**, indicating openness to buying electric vehicles but with some reservations.
- **Millennials**: They record an average score of **2.54** and are relatively less interested compared to Gen Z but demonstrate interest at a moderate rate.
- **Age 44+**: Scored **3.07**, the highest among all groups, indicating a stronger willingness to adopt electric cars.

### Belief in the Impact of Climate Change
The survey also asked about perceptions of the role electric cars play in combating climate change:

- **Generation Z**: **71%** believe electric cars will be important to solving climate problems.
- **Millennials**: **79%** showed the most belief in the environmental merits of electric cars.
- **Aged 44 and over**: Only **47%** agreed, reflecting more skepticism about how effective they can be in dealing with environmental concerns.

These results show that there is an opportunity to reach Generation Z and Millennials more effectively with electric vehicle sustainability campaigns.

## Discussion

### Interpreting the Results
The data shows that Gen Z demonstrates moderate interest but is rather more neutral towards electric cars, presumably because of concerns over affordability, practical utility, or cultural relevance.  
Millennials, being normally environmentally conscious and financially secure, exhibit a positive perception and a moderate likelihood to buy.  
The oldest generations generally become the most enthusiastic, maybe due to greater financial resources or established environmental awareness.

### Strategic Implications
These groups can be engaged effectively by Aston Martin through the following strategies:

- **Gen Z Targeted Campaigns**: Utilize social media influencers and digital storytelling to indicate how electric cars align with sustainability and modern values.
- **Affordability in Models for Millennials**: Entry-level luxury models bridge the aspirational appeal to affordability for Millennials.
- **Messaging for Older Groups**: Emphasizing themes of reliability, novelty, and environmental friendliness would further nurture their positive attitudes.

### Limitations and Challenges
This study has a number of limitations:

- **Small Sample Size**: The sample size in this project is small, with only 72 participants, which may not allow generalization.
- **Self-Reported Data**: Survey responses may be biased by participants' current state of knowledge and beliefs.
- **Simplified Age Groups**: The division into broad categories may mask the subtle differences that exist within each group.

Expanding the data as well as carefully selecting contacts to provide more diverse data, including other demographic variables such as income and location, and using methods to reduce bias in self-reporting data are recommended to address these limitations.

### Future Research Directions
For further research, the following areas can be explored:

- **Cultural Trends**: How different cultural backgrounds can shape people's attitudes towards electric cars.
- **Technological Awareness**: Explore knowledge gaps across generations regarding relevant technological advancements in electric vehicle technology.
- **Economic Barriers**: Investigate how economic barriers to adoption, such as purchase costs and incentives, influence consumer choice.

These steps can provide further insight into how strategies should be targeted to best capture the interest of different demographics.


## Conclusion

Before discuse conclusion, we are going to explain the charts mentioned above. I the charts we have:

**Chart 1: General Perception of Electric Cars**
The first chart shows the average general perception of electric cars across different generations. Generation Z has a slightly lower average perception score compared to Millennials and the Other age group. Millennials and the Other group have similar levels of perception, with the Other group having the highest. This suggests that while all generations generally have a positive view of electric cars, Generation Z may have a slightly less favorable perception than the older groups.


*   **Generation Z has a positive perception of electric cars, but this perception is lower than that of Millennials and the "Other" group.**

**Chart 2: Likelihood of Purchasing an Electric Car**
The second chart illustrates the likelihood of each generation considering the purchase of an electric car in the next five years. Here, the Other age group shows the highest level of interest in purchasing electric cars, followed by Generation Z, and finally Millennials. This pattern indicates that while Generation Z shows moderate interest in adopting electric cars, the Other age group (likely older generations or unclassified respondents) is the most open to making a purchase, perhaps reflecting a greater purchasing power or different lifestyle needs.

*   **The "Other" group shows the highest willingness to purchase electric cars, followed by Generation Z. This may be due to differences in financial capability or varying needs.**

**Chart 3: Belief in Electric Cars for Climate Change**
The third chart examines the belief across generations regarding electric cars' importance in combating climate change. Millennials have the highest level of belief in electric cars' role in addressing climate issues, followed closely by Generation Z. The Other age group, however, has a significantly lower level of agreement, suggesting that they may be more skeptical about the environmental impact of electric cars. This result shows that younger generations, especially Millennials, are more likely to see electric cars as essential for environmental benefits, aligning with trends in environmental awareness among younger people.

*  **The "Millennials" have the strongest belief in the importance of electric cars for combating climate change, and Generation Z also holds this belief to a significant extent. However, the "Other" group shows more skepticism in this regard.**

###**At the end, for conclusion we can say these charts collectively suggest that while all generations show some level of positivity towards electric cars, Millennials and Generation Z are more aligned in seeing electric cars as beneficial for the environment, while the Other age group shows stronger interest in purchasing, perhaps due to different priorities or purchasing capacity.**
